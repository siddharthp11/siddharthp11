### Hey there! Here's a little bit about me- 
- ðŸ”­ current interests: 
    - i love shell apps that can improve your productivity as a dev and otherwise.
    - i've enjoyed building playgrounds on streamlit, curious to learn more about how these are built
    - i build using flutter but more recently i've been using react.

- ðŸŒ± iâ€™m currently learning:
    - ML: parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA, prefix-tuning) to fine-tune larger O(100 mil params) models 
    - Design: React + Electron to build for desktop.
  
- ðŸ’¬ ask me about:
    - nlp : transformers, peft, data pipelines 
    - bash : cli tools 
    - python: prototyping and experiments 
    - flutter: mobile app dev
